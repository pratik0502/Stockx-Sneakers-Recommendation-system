Aside from her Comme des Garçons collections, she has had numerous sneaker collaborations over the years. One of the most outstanding of these collaborations involves her different iterations of work modifying and styling up the Converse Chuck Taylor with her sub-label Comme des Garçons PLAY. Kawakubo’s first iteration of his Converse Chuck Taylors came about in 2009 when she modified the original by stripping back its contrast stitching. Six years later, in 2015, she took the All Star Chuck 70s as her template and created a shoe so beloved that it has been re-released every year since.
<br>
<br>
The most immediately recognizable thing in shoes from the Comme des Garçons PLAY line is their heart and eyes logo, originally conceived and created by Filip Pagowski. Unlike the original 2009 version, however, the 2015 version and every version thereafter has moved away from the original minimalist philosophy that inspired Kawakubo to start this line of collaborations. The Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star 70s Hi Comme des Garçons PLAY harks back to the classic 70s Chuck Taylor style but with a high-top collar that snugly hugs the ankles and a black upper, white laces and a white sole and toe cap.

In familiar Black Toe color blocking, the upper of the Jordan 1 Volt Gold is composed of white, black, and yellow leather. A Volt yellow-tinted panel donning the Jordan Wings logo wraps the ankle.

The Kobe 6 Grinch originally debuted in 2011 when Kobe Bryant’s Los Angeles Lakers faced LeBron James’ Miami Heat in a legendary match up on Christmas Day. This is the first Kobe 6 to receive the Kobe Protro treatment, a design process that takes classic Kobe designs and updates them with modern tech for improved performance.
<br>
<br>
At a first glance, the Nike Kobe 6 Grinch looks identically like the OG pair from 2011: it features a Green Apple and Volt textured, snake-inspired upper as a tribute to Kobe’s Black Mamba moniker. A black Swoosh, red Kobe branding on the tongue, and green translucent outsole accentuate the shoe’s reptile theme. But, because this is a Protro, there are some differences. The updated Kobe 6 Grinch arrives with a more responsive Zoom Air cushioning system and scaled-down traction for an improved court feel. The silhouette shape is even altered to provide a lower, sleeker fit.

The Nike Killshot 2 J Crew Sail Midnight Navy features a retro design that's reminiscent of Nike's original shoes from the 1970s. The shoe starts with a thick tan sole with an aged, weathered appearance and then leads to a clean, off-white upper with gray accents and a navy Swoosh logo. Instead of rubber, the Nike Killshot 2 J Crew Sail Midnight Navy comes with a gum sole with a textured underside to complete the retro look. For a final touch, ""NIKE"" is printed on the heel in weathered navy letters to suggest that this sneaker has seen a lot of history.

These Jordan 4s were made in collaboration with rapper, Travis Scott and nicknamed the ""Cactus Jack"" edition. Similar in design to the infamous Eminem pair, these feature a lighter shade of blue suede on the upper. Black accents, a red liner, paint splatter detailing, a white midsole and ""Cactus Jack"" branding on the back heel tab finish things off for this pair. These dropped in June of 2018 for $225 and came exclusively in men’s sizes. If you’re a fan of Travis Scott and the AJ 4, this pair is another must-have.

Wotherspoon and adidas started their Super Earth initiative in 2020, a project aimed at decreasing waste through pattern efficiency, recycled material selection, and vegan-first design. The first silhouette to have the Super Earth moniker was the adidas Superstar, and its design emphasized the beauty of vegan-friendly leather. As part of adidas’ A-ZX collection, Wotherspoon continued his upcycled philosophy and approach to sneakers with the ZX8000 model.
<br>
<br>
The adidas ZX8000 Sean Wotherspoon Super Earth is a collage of different upcycled textiles, each with its own distinct look and texture. The upper is composed of a mix of flannel, denim, and canvas, similar to the range of materials one would find in Wotherspoon’s Round Two Vintage stores. Green plaid flannel makes up the design’s toe wrap and heel tab, while brown and red canvases cover the vamp, side panels, eyestays, and heel. On the side panel, canvas Three Stripes branding overlaps white and neon green flower embroidery. Lastly, a clear heel unit, ""Super Earth"" script on the tongue, and a cream Torsion sole round out this Earth-friendly design.
