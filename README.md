# Web-Crawler-for-Stock-Sneakers-Data-Crawling-and-Recommendation-System

## Aim:
This project aims to crawl data from the stocks sneakers category using a web crawler and build a recommendation system based on similarity analysis.

## Description:
In this project, a web crawler is created to extract data from the stocks sneakers category. The crawled data is then processed and analyzed to build a recommendation system for sneakers. The data is cleaned, filtered, and transformed to include relevant features such as product name, brand, color, model, description, and product ID. Duplicate and missing values are removed, and a new dataframe for tags is created. The text is vectorized using bags of words approach and cosine similarity is calculated to measure the similarity between shoes. Finally, a function is implemented to recommend similar shoes based on a given input shoe. The processed data and similarity matrix are saved using pickle for future use.

## Conclusion:
In this project, a web crawler was successfully developed to extract data from the stocks sneakers category. The data was processed and transformed to include relevant features and remove duplicates and missing values. A recommendation system was built using cosine similarity analysis, allowing users to find similar shoes based on their input. The processed data and similarity matrix were saved for future use. This project provides a foundation for further analysis and exploration in the field of stock sneakers.
